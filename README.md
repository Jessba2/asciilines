Copyright (c) 2019 Jessica Barnett

Asciilines is an application that takes an input file of instructions and outputs a graphic made of ascii characters.

## Installation
```
```
## Intended Usage
```
This is an example of how the program should work.

From an input file like this example
3 4
* 1 -1 h 5
# -1 1 v 5

The output should be
.#..
*#**
.#..

```

## Issues
Currently the program builds a dynamic 2d array and initializes it with "." for each element.

Still needs to take instructions in and output a graphic.
